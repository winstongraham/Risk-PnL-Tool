üìò Risk & PnL Tool Documentation

This document outlines the structure and functionality of the Risk and PnL Dashboard project modules: portfolio.py, risk_metrics.py, and utils.py, along with how they integrate into the Streamlit app.

üì¶ Project Overview

The Risk and Profit & Loss (PnL) Tool is a financial dashboard built in Python using Streamlit. It is designed from the perspective of a bank to manage its trading desk‚Äôs exposure. It calculates position-level PnL, portfolio-level metrics, and evaluates key risk metrics like Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, and Value at Risk (VaR).

üßÆ portfolio.py

This module handles all computations related to profit and loss, returns, and portfolio valuation.

üîß Functions

calculate_pnl(prices, entry_prices, quantities)

Description: Computes the unrealized PnL for each instrument.

Inputs:

prices: dict of latest market prices ({"AAPL": 160.0})

entry_prices: dict of entry prices ({"AAPL": 150.0})

quantities: dict of quantities ({"AAPL": 1000})

Returns: dict of unrealized PnL per instrument

calculate_portfolio_value(prices, quantities)

Description: Computes the total value of the portfolio using current market prices.

Returns: Total portfolio value

calculate_daily_returns(price_series)

Description: Computes daily returns from historical price data.

Inputs: pandas DataFrame with symbols as columns

Returns: DataFrame of daily % returns

üìä risk_metrics.py

This module contains functions that calculate financial risk metrics for the portfolio.

üîß Functions

calculate_sharpe(returns, risk_free_rate=0.01)

Description: Computes Sharpe ratio.

Inputs:

returns: Series or DataFrame of returns

risk_free_rate: Annual risk-free rate (default 1%)

Returns: Sharpe ratio (float)

calculate_drawdown(equity_curve)

Description: Calculates drawdowns over time and identifies the max drawdown.

Inputs: pandas Series of portfolio value

Returns: drawdown Series and max drawdown value

calculate_var(returns, confidence_level=0.95)

Description: Calculates Value at Risk (VaR) using historical simulation or percentile method.

Inputs:

returns: Series of returns

confidence_level: e.g., 0.95

Returns: float VaR value

üîß utils.py

This is the helper module that includes utility functions used throughout the app.

üîß Functions

fetch_price_data(symbols, start, end)

Description: Pulls historical adjusted close prices from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.

Returns: pandas DataFrame of prices

parse_input_list(str_input)

Description: Parses a comma-separated string from the UI into a clean list.

üñ•Ô∏è Streamlit App Snippet

st.title("\U0001F3E6 Bank Risk & PnL Dashboard")

symbols = st.sidebar.text_input("Instruments (comma separated)", "AAPL, TSLA").upper().split(",")
quantities = st.sidebar.text_input("Position Sizes (comma separated)", "1000, 500").split(",")
entry_prices = st.sidebar.text_input("Entry Prices (comma separated)", "150, 700").split(",")

This UI feeds inputs into the tool and passes them to your helper and PnL functions.

‚úÖ Summary

File

Responsibilities

portfolio.py

PnL, returns, and valuation logic

risk_metrics.py

Sharpe ratio, drawdown, VaR calculations

utils.py

Data fetching, input parsing

Each module is self-contained and easy to test independently. The Streamlit app then brings them together into an interactive dashboard experience.

For further extension, consider adding:

Trade logs

Historical PnL visualization

Risk limits breach alerts
